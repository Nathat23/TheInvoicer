# TheInvoicer

This is a program written in Java for the NEA component of my Computer Science A-level. It's a program designed to generate invoices. It really shouldn't be used for anything but it's here for reference. Uses JavaFX, JFXtras, MariaDB, HikariCP, SnakeYAML and JavaMail libaries.

MariaDB database is used to store customers, jobs and job rates and job items. 

Invoices are generated by using a template HTML document with placeholders that get replaced by the required information. The HTML is then rendered in a browser object where it can be printed or emailed
